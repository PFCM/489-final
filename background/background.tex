\chapter{Background and Related Work}\label{C:bg}
\section{Background}
\subsection{Feed-Forward Neural Networks}
This is to be pretty brief. Cover useful things -- what they look like, gradient descent
(in brief) and outline some results on the expressive power.
\subsection{Recurrent Neural Networks}
What they look like, what they can do, how to train them (and when/why it doesn't work).
LSTMs and GRUs? Or in related work?

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Long Time Dependencies}
Summary of approaches to fix vanishing gradients.
\subsection{Memory}
Summary of approaches to augmenting RNNs with extra memory, or other approaches to better
use memory.
\subsection{Tensors in Neural Networks}
Including gated networks, MRNN and so on.
