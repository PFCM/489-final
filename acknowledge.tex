\chapter*{Acknowledgments}\label{C:ack} 

Firstly I would like to thank my supervisors David and Marcus for a constant stream of ideas and making it
possible to pull this project together into a coherent whole.
Also Alex Telfar, for valuable discussions which were sometimes even on topic and
Harry Ross, for occasionally entering the firing line when I felt the urge to try and explain something.

I would also thank the School of Engineering and Computer Science for essential computational resources 
 as well as
everyone working in Cotton 240 for being relaxed, friendly and
not wiping my notes off the whiteboard.

I am grateful to Jack Branthwaite for all the coffee, the impact of which can not be understated. Also
Timothy Barraclough for giving me plenty of motivation
and my indoor cricket team the Caged Sharks for giving me an
opportunity to run around in circles for a few hours a week.
